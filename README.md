A project intended to help UPSC aspirants.

## About the project

This is supposed to be a one stop solution for all the needs of an aspirant starting from the pre-req knowledge to mock tests.
I may roll down awesome features in the future but for now it's just a basic app. Although i have many ideas it's not really easy to get time. But i will keep the app functional.

PS. Any help would be appreciated. I'd love a hand helping me in developing or a few bucks to pay the server fee which is used to facilitate the chat option for you guys.

#### PSS. Some books are copyrighted and I don't have permission to share it nor do i support pirated material.
